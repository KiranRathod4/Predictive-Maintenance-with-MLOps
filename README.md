# Predictive Maintenance with MLOps

## 1. Problem Statement
Industrial companies lose millions from unexpected machine breakdowns.  
Traditional preventive maintenance (fixed schedules) is inefficient.  

**Goal:** Build an ML system to predict equipment failures in advance using sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure, etc.), enabling timely intervention.

## 2. Data Sources
- [NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset (CMAPSS)](https://data.nasa.gov/)  
- [PHM Society Data Challenge Datasets](https://www.phmsociety.org/)  
- Simulated IoT sensor streams (Kafka / IoT Hub)

## 3. End-to-End Tech Stack

| Stage              | Tools / Tech |
|--------------------|--------------|
| **Data Ingestion** | Apache Kafka (streaming), Airflow (batch pipelines) |
| **Data Storage**   | AWS S3 / GCS for raw data, PostgreSQL for metadata |
| **Data Versioning**| DVC (Data Version Control) |
| **Processing & Features** | Pandas, PySpark, Scikit-learn, Feature Store (Feast) |
| **Modeling**       | Scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch (LSTMs for time-series) |
| **Experiment Tracking** | MLflow |
| **Model Registry** | MLflow Model Registry |
| **Deployment**     | FastAPI + Docker + Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) |
| **CI/CD**          | GitHub Actions + Terraform for infra-as-code |
| **Monitoring**     | Evidently AI (drift detection), Prometheus + Grafana |
| **Logging**        | ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) |

## 4. System Architecture
```

IoT Sensors → Kafka → Data Lake (S3/GCS)

Airflow ETL → Feature Store (Feast)

ML Model Training Pipeline → MLflow (Experiments + Registry)

CI/CD triggers build → Docker image → Deploy to Kubernetes

Prediction Service (FastAPI) → Accessible via REST/gRPC

Monitoring Layer: Drift detection + error logs + performance dashboard

```

## 5. ML Pipeline

### 🔹 Preprocessing
- Handle missing sensor readings  
- Normalize signals  
- Extract rolling statistics (moving avg, variance, FFT features)  

### 🔹 Feature Engineering
- Time-to-failure (label engineering)  
- Sensor correlation features  

### 🔹 Modeling
- **Baseline:** Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Advanced:** LSTM/GRU for sequential sensor data  
- **Ensemble:** Blend tree + deep learning models  

### 🔹 Evaluation
- Metrics: F1-score, Precision@K (early warnings), ROC-AUC  
- Cost analysis: savings vs false alarms

## 6. Deployment & MLOps

### ⚙️ CI/CD
- On code commit → tests run → retrain if new data → deploy updated container automatically.  

### 🟢 Canary Deployment
- Gradual rollout of new model to 10% of machines, monitor performance, then expand.  

### 📊 Monitoring
- Track sensor distribution (drift detection)  
- Track failure prediction accuracy in real world  
- Auto-trigger retraining if drift threshold exceeded

## 7. Deliverables (Resume-Ready Highlights)

- ✅ Built **end-to-end Predictive Maintenance ML system** handling streaming IoT sensor data.  
- ✅ Deployed scalable **FastAPI microservice** with **Docker + Kubernetes (AWS)**.  
- ✅ Implemented **MLOps (CI/CD, model registry, drift detection, automated retraining)** using MLflow, Evidently AI, Airflow.  
- ✅ Designed **real-time monitoring dashboard (Prometheus + Grafana)** for live equipment health tracking.  
- ✅ Achieved **85%+ accuracy** in early fault detection, reducing unplanned downtime risk.

## 8. Optional Extensions (For Extra “Wow” Factor)
- **Edge Deployment:** Deploy lightweight models on Raspberry Pi/Jetson Nano for on-device inference.  
- **Digital Twin:** Build a virtual simulation of equipment performance.  
- **Explainability:** Use SHAP values to explain why a machine is predicted to fail.
